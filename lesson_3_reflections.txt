When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to cooperate with other people, or to backup my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I may be working on the local repository and don't want to incorporate changes
    done by others on my local files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are "clones" of repositories within GitHub.
    Clones are copies of repositories on local machines or between GitHub and local machines.
    Branches are the labels development paths of a repository from a starting state.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This useful to track any changes done by the other contributors on the remote which may differ
    from the changes that we commit locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It is hard to collaborate properly without using Git or GitHub regarding the complexity of the the
    changes introduced by the different collaborators and the difficulty so sync between them.
   	It is true that learning to work with Git and GitHub is difficult at the beginning but it surely
   	facilitate a lot of collaboration and sync work.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    We would make changes in a separate branch When we want to discuss changes with others before committing these changes directly to the master branch. This approach keeps the master branch intact before we agree with the other collaborators on the changes.
