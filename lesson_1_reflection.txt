How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    That helps.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    Pros: more flexibility
    Cons: one have to remember to commit when it is time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git consider the files in one repository as interconnected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --> commit IDs
    git diff "commit_ID1" "commit_ID2" --> differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I am confident now in making any changes.
